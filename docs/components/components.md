# Components

Components are reusable, interactive elements that help build consistent user interfaces. They cover various functions such as actions, layout, communication, navigation, selection, and text inputâ€”ensuring accessibility and visual harmony across products. Each component is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing seamless integration into different projects to improve usability and enhance the overall user experience.
